<p>They didn't talk much at first.</p>
<br>
<p>Max had seen his fair share of hard times, but realized that he didn't have a clue about grit until he met Tar. That Tar was able to hang on to any shred of his humanity or spirit was incredible - he had lost count of how many years he was forced to be a hired gun for the institute. It was clear that it had taken a toll on him - he barely slept and barely ate in the first days of their journey. But, as they got further away from Aetherwall, and settled into a routine free of any coercion or crimes against humanity, Max could see that he was starting to get his old self back.</p>
<br>
<p>They hardly knew each other, but Max slowly found out that there was still a person under Tar's leathery outer shell. He would whistle tunes while making the fire for the night, and every now and then would actually crack a joke. Max never found the jokes funny, but chuckled to humor him. The places they journeyed through were breathtaking, and they would often take it in walking side by side, neither of them saying anything.</p>
<br>
<p>Max surprised Tar as well. At first, he took him for a punk kid that didn't care about anything other than dismantling whatever was in front of him. But seeing Max not surrounded by enemies for the first time, it became clear that he deeply cared about people and hated power because of how easily it was abused. He would give tar a double serving of rabbit stew, or patch up his cloak while he was sleeping, always trying to get away with it even though they were the only two people around.</p>
<br>
<p>As they continued to travel, without a plan, they got used to each other and grew closer. Late-night campfires under the stars turned into opportunities for vulnerable conversations, where they shared their dreams, fears, and desires. They found that they could trust each other, which was something neither of them expected they would find in anyone ever again.</p>
<br>
<p>On top of this, both of them were SMOKING HOT, so they FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKED</p>
